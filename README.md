# HW-MMOG-research

## Purpose

This repository is for my research into a number of MMOs hosted here on Git, exploring common issues they encounter and focusing on the network arcitecture and connection types they may use. MMOs by their nature must have a heavy reliance on a users connection, and as such the flow of data from the server to the client must be carefully managed. This data must not be too heavy on the bandwidth, and quick enough to avoid a desyncronisation issue, rubber banding, or other similar connectionr elated problems that online games can frequently encounter.
