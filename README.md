# HW-MMOG-research

## Purpose

MMOs are a huge market, from long running MMORPGs like Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, to more modern takes on the MMO stage with the likes of Fortnite, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and the recently released New World. Each of these games has a large userbase, numbering from the tens of thousands to millions of players. While they all vary heavily from each other, they all have many things in common as well, such as requiring stable netcode and enabling hundreds to thousands of players to meet and play together all at once. From the smallest to the largest, they all require companies to invest a lot of time, money and resources into developing the server infrastructure to ensre that their players have a stable, smooth experience.

This repository is for my research into a number of MMOs hosted here on Git, exploring common issues they encounter and focusing on the network arcitecture and connection types they may use. MMOs by their nature must have a heavy reliance on a users connection, and as such the flow of data from the server to the client must be carefully managed. This data must not be too heavy on the bandwidth, and quick enough to avoid a desyncronisation issue, rubber banding, or other similar connectionr elated problems that online games can frequently encounter.

In this table, I have listed several games that will be used in this report. Many will be direct here from Git, to allow indepth testing, while others may be mainstream IP using publicly available data, albeit with the caveat that this data might not be entirely accurate as a result of companies picking and hcoosing what they reveal.
